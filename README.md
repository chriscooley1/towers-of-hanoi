# Towers of Hanoi

This project implements the classic Towers of Hanoi game using React components.

## Overview

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three towers and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on one tower, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

## Features

- Renders the game with graphical representation of towers and disks using SVG images.
- Implements the game logic to allow users to interact and move disks between towers.
- Responsive design using CSS for tower and disk layout.
- Created by Chris Cooley.
